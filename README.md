# Chess v5.0


## Chess Engine Overview
This is a chess engine developed in C++. The engine implements various chess algorithms, including minimax with alpha-beta pruning, transposition tables, and piece-square tables for evaluation.


## Fixes - v5.2.3
- Fixes a debug error causing an abort() call when closing the window.
- Ensures that information related to unexpected exits is now properly saved in the appdata folder.
- Adds functionality to create a 'setting.json' file to remember the last depth entered by the user.
- Enhances the application to save ELO ratings to the 'setting.json' file after calculation.


## Features
The Current Release v5.2.3 Includes The Following Features

- Singleplayer Mode(Against AI)
- Multiplayer Mode
- Loading Game From FEN

## Configuration
The engine's behavior and settings can be configured in the following ways:

The Search depth Can be set inside settings. For more Control you can can navigate over to ChessEngine.h header file, and change the following Property `MAX_DEPTH`. To avoid Long search times This is set to 3 by Default. You can Change this to any value, according to your device. 


*Changing `MAX_DEPTH` will increase Search times, and might even cause the program to crash completely*


## Concepts relevant to Project
v5.2.3 uses polymorphism to Assign Chess Pieces to the Board. Instead of Using a single Class for Chess Pieces, I have derived Six Classes from the ChessPiece class, and then Dynamically Assigned Chess Pieces on the Board. (This is still a Very basic Implementation of Polymorphism
